Despite your website promising delivery within three days, the product arrived\nonly yesterday, missing her birthday entirely.\nI attempted to contact your customer service multiple times for an explanation and to expedite the\ndelivery, but to no avail. My calls and emails went unanswered, leaving me in a difficult position with\nno gift for Emily’s special day.\nThis experience has left a sour taste, and I am reconsidering future purchases from WidgetCorp. I\nexpect a prompt explanation and an assurance that such delays will not occur in the future.\nSincerely,\nJane Doe \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"text = \"\"\"Chère WidgetCorp,\nJe vous écris pour exprimer ma vive déception quant à votre service en ce qui concerne mon dernier achat (commande #98765). J'avais commandé le \"SuperWidget\" en tant que cadeau d'anniversaire pour ma fille Emily, dont le jour des naissances était le 15 mars. Bien que votre site web promettait une livraison dans les trois jours, le produit n'a été livré qu'hier, manquant ainsi son anniversaire.\nJ'ai tenté de contacter votre service client plusieurs fois pour obtenir une explication et pour accélérer la livraison, mais sans succès. Mes appels et mes e-mails restaient sans réponse, laissant dans une situation difficile sans cadeau pour l'anniversaire d'Emily.\nCette expérience a laissé un goût amer, et je me demande si je vais continuer à faire des achats chez WidgetCorp dans l'avenir. Je vous attend une explication rapide et une assurance que de tels retards ne se reproduiront pas dans l'avenir.\nSincèrement,\nJane Doe\"\"\"\n\n# Translate the text from French to English\nquery = \"Translate the following text to English: \"\nprompt = query + \"\\n\" + text\ninput_ids = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids\ngeneration_output = model.generate(\n    input_ids=input_ids, max_new_tokens=900)\ntranslated_text = tokenizer.decode(generation_output[0])\nprint (translated_text)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-01-30T09:46:40.377093Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-01-30T09:46:40.377532Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-01-30T09:46:40.377302Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-01-30T09:46:40.377321Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
